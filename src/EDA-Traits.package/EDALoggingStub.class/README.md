I'm a stub to provide logging via EDATLogging to target classes we cannot change directly.

I'm expected to be used by extension methods to use EDATLogging.

I rely on EDATLogging to provide logging to target classes.

Example:

To add EDATLogging-based logging to ZnLogEvent class, add an extension method such as
"*EDA-Logging"
logToStdout
	self stopLoggingToTranscript.
   	^ self announcer when: ZnLogEvent do: [ :event | EDATLoggingStub new logInfoMessage: event ]
